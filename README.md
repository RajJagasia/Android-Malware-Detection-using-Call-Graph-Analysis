# Android-Malware-Detection-using-Call-Graph-Analysis
Dissertation fourth year Honors project 

**To utilize this the layout of the project should look like:** <br>

|-> ./Notebook File (The current file) *(file)*<br>

|-> ./ben_all (This folder contains all the benign api call graphs) *(dir)*<br>
|-> ./mal_all (This folder contains all the malware api call graphs) *(dir)*<br>

(The Code to generate the below will be given in the notebooks that use api call list) *(dir)*<br>
|-> ./Call List/ben_all (This folder contains all the benign api call lists)  *(dir)*<br>
|-> ./Call List/mal_all (This folder contains all the malware api call lists) *(dir)*<br>

(The Code to generate the below will be given in the notebooks that use sensitive api call graphs) *(dir)*<br>
|-> ./SFCG/ben_all (This folder contains all the sensitive benign api call graphs) (FOR THE GNN_2nd Implementation for order 1) *(dir)*<br>
|-> ./SFCG/mal_all (This folder contains all the sensitive malware api call graphs) (FOR THE GNN_2nd Implementation for order 1) *(dir)*<br>

|-> ./SFCG/ben_all (This folder contains all the sensitive benign api call graphs) (FOR THE GNN_2nd Implementation for order 2) *(dir)*<br>
|-> ./SFCG/mal_all (This folder contains all the sensitive malware api call graphs) (FOR THE GNN_2nd Implementation for order 2) *(dir)*<br>


|-> ./SFCG_modified/ben_all (This folder contains all the sensitive benign api call graphs) (FOR THE GNN_2nd Implementation for only sensitive api graph order 0) *(dir)*<br>
|-> ./SFCG_modified/mal_all (This folder contains all the sensitive malware api call graphs) (FOR THE GNN_2nd Implementation for only sensitive api graph order 0) *(dir)*<br>

(The below files contain the trained models and extracted datasets for each implementation) <br>
|-> ./CNN_IMPLEMENTATION_STUFF (This folder contains the trained models and extracted datasets for the CNN Implementation) *(dir)*<br>
|-> ./LSTM_IMPLEMENTATION_EXTRA (This folder contains the trained models and extracted datasets for the LSTM Implementation) *(dir)*<br>
|-> ./GNN1_IMPLEMENTATION_EXTRA (This folder contains the trained models and extracted datasets for the GNN Paper A Implementation) *(dir)*<br>
|-> ./GNN2_IMPLEMENTATION_EXTRA (This folder contains the trained models and extracted datasets for the GNN Paper B Implementation) *(dir)*<br>
